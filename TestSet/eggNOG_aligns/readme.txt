Alignments generated by EggNOG v4.5.1
Trimmed alignments were produced by querying Eubacteria with E.coli

********************
The phylogenes directory contains alignments for the 10 housekeeping
genes employed by Rivoire and Junier in their Plos ONE 2016
paper. These genes were in turn selected based on Zeigler DR,
International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Biology, 2003,
53:1893. The genes represent the following COGS:
126G  3-phosphoglycerate kinase (pgk)
173J  Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase  (aspS)
202K  DNA directed RNA polymerase, alpha subunit (rpoA)
2255L Holliday junction resolvasome RuvABC (ruvB)
481M  (481J?) translation elongation factor, EF-4, (lepA)
497L  DNA repair ATPase RecN (recN)
541U  Signal recognition particle GTPase (ffH)
544O  FKBP-type peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (trigger factor) (tig)
556L  Excinuclease UvrABC helicase subunit UvrB (uvrB)
1158K Transcription termination factor Rho (rho)

Adding additional alignments for testset genes: purE, purK, purC,
ilvC, ilvN, ilvB, glgA, glgC
As for previous set, alignments were generated by EggNOG v4.5.1,
Trimmed alingments were produced by querying Eubacteria with E. coli
